# Emaily
Easily send promotion / marketing emails to multiple potential clients.

TODOS:

* Change the payment method to use react-stripe-js instead of react-stripe-checkout.
* Change the mailer class to a function.
* Change the mailer service provider.
* Change the redirect urls for the survey feedback 'Yes' and 'No' to something more asthetic.
* Use react-hook-form instead of redux-form.
* Protect routes that are only supposed to be seen by logged-in users.
* Allow surveys to be created in 'draft mode'.
* Allow client sorting of sent surveys.
* Allow users to specify the 'from' field on survey emails.
* Allow users to delete surveys that have been sent.
* Improve the design of the survey list cards.
